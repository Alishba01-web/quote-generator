# quote-generator

This is a simple yet interactive Random Quote Generator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app displays a new motivational or inspirational quote each time the user clicks the “Generate Quote” button. It dynamically updates the content using JavaScript and provides a clean, minimal user interface.

This project helped me practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive design, and is a part of my frontend learning journey.
